# Security101
Hey guys and girls. I see a lot of new ppl into crypto but also i see here ppl new to the internet. We are making money here so be sure to be safe!
Here are some tips from a Senior Information Security Engineer that could boost your security in the space!
I will be talking about what you can do for yourself and why you should do this and describe some basic attacks on persons using social engineering and how to avoid being wrecked!

1. Phishing
So phishing is an ancient technique of hacking and still one of the best workings in the world. I made so many phishing exercises with stupid scenarios that you would not believe it works in well-respected companies so you should ask yourself why it would not work on you?

First of all most of the phishing attempts will be based on psychological and basic instincts like fear, greed, and curiosity. 
Hackers will try to play on your feeling which will forceyou to open malicous attachment or enter to malicious site.

Hello this is Mr.X from KuCoin 
We have noticed suspecious transactions on your account. 
Please verify yourself by logging to the page https://www.kucojn.com/verifySafe?userId=4493
```
First of all
Calm down Your emotions when you see email like this and analyze the content. 

Verify The Sender: 
https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/5-ways-to-detect-a-phishing-email
```
No legitimate organisation will send emails from an address that ends ‘@gmail.com’.

Not even Google.

Most organisations, except some small operations, will have their own email domain and company accounts. For example, legitimate emails from Google will read ‘@google.com’.

If the domain name (the bit after the @ symbol) matches the apparent sender of the email, the message is probably legitimate.

The best way to check an organisation’s domain name is to type the company’s name into a search engine.

This makes detecting phishing seem easy, but cyber criminals have plenty of tricks up their sleeves to deceive you.

Top tip: Look at the email address, not just the sender

Many of us don’t ever look at the email address that a message has come from.

Your inbox displays a name, like ‘IT Governance’, and the subject line. When you open the email, you already know (or think you know) who the message is from and jump straight into the content.

When crooks create their bogus email addresses, they often have the choice to select the display name, which doesn’t have to relate to the email address at all.

They can, therefore, use a bogus email address that will turn up in your inbox with the display name Google.

But criminals rarely depend on their victim’s ignorance alone. Their bogus email addresses will use the spoofed organisation’s name in the local part of the address.

Second of all verify the domain, maybe during this boring article you did not notice the diffrence betweeen kucoin and kucojn :wizz:

2.Malicious files

This one is regarding phishing and messages that you could get via Discord for example.
Probably you know that you should always avoid malicious *.exe files from the internet, but have you ever thought about csv (ALL excel formats) etc.?

Your cool abroad colleague is sending you GAINZ.cvs and you re excited to open it (again feels, curiosity), and he made a cool macro in cvs that is calculating gains in real-time :o but you need to click "Enable Editing". What could get wrong?

So excel allows creating macros in VBA which is a programing language so you could potentially run malware. Here is an example game is written in excel VBA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vbjpJIRtJk

ps. it is a good habit to do not accept any files from persons meet on the internet.

3.Storing Password in Clear Text

Just no. You never store password on your computer in clear text or Encoded in base64.

4.2FA
Yes, always.

5.Mobile Applications
This is really funny part. Because most of the time we are downloading and installing a lot of mobile applications without reading what permissions do application need. Be careful with that.  A lot of application is running with excessive permissions. For example why your new downloaded "Calc App" need access to photos or microphone or even sms?
Some permissions you should avoid (https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/android-permissions-full-guide/)
```
READ_CALENDAR,
 WRITE_CALENDAR, 
 CAMERA, 
 READ_CONTACTS, 
 WRITE_CONTACTS, 
 RECORD_AUDIO, 
 READ_PHONE_NUMBERS, 
 CALL_PHONE, 
 ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS, 
 SEND_SMS, 
 RECEIVE_SMS, 
 READ_SMS
```
For example apps like Instagram need your permissions to use the camera but it should not read/send sms.

5. Password's 
Please use complex passwords, during my career we compromised a lot of applications/systems just because of weak credentials. 
Adding 12# at the end of your name is not a strong password. 

Also, try to use different passwords for different types of services/webs. Because once on "big" company is compromised, the database could be leaked to the internet. 
By having different passwords for different services your other accounts are safe.

ps. If your password is in a list like this  https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt you should consider changing it immediately.

6. Some other tips
-If you are using pirated software etc. you should consider buying a second computer/piece of hardware etc just for trading crypto. You never know what is in "hacked software". 

-I know, lot of gains lot of happiness. But try to keep it for yourself. Money loves silence big money loves grave silence. 

-Be prepared, always have your mental firewall on! Social engineering is the strongest exploit in human history. I would recommend all of you to read the book of Kevin Mitnick The Art of Deception "I broke people, not passwords". There are some great stories of people who stole money, data or enter some restricted areas only using words. For example, how to stole 9 million dollars using only phone call :>


Be safe yoyo
